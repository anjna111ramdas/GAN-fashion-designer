A generative model called the GAN, or Generative Adversarial Network, may produce graphics by studying the probability distribution of a large dataset of images. Because it lets me to produce high-quality arts or designs even without the technical or aesthetic expertise in drawing, I have always found GANs to be fascinating. In order to express my interest in the fashion industry, I came up with a method for creating dresses without the help of a professional designer. As a result, I developed the programme ClothingGAN, which enables collaborative clothing creation without a high level of technical knowledge.
